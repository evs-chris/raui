Windows are presented within the Host in the style of a desktop multiple document interface. This allows the usable space on the screen to be utilized by multiple windows at once if possible. By default, the Host will watch its available size and automatically maximize windows once a certain breakpoint is reached (60em).\n\n    #### Host\n\n    A Host contains a list of Windows for which it manages positioning, sizing, and stacking. The Host also manages blocking (modality) of windows that prevent other windows from being the target of interaction. Blocking can take place globally as well, so you can easily implement, for instance, a message box that blocks the entire host until it is closed or a detail input window that only blocks its caller.\n\n    The Host has special support for maximized windows that allows you to render special content at the top of the Host while a window is maximized. This is typically used to integrate the window controls and title into an AppBar. Additionally, there is a mode, controlled by `@style.window.maxFrom`, that will automatically maximize windows when its environment gets narrower than the set value.\n\n    The Host _also_ has support for toasting because with windowed applications, it's much easier to get to the Host than it may be to access a Shell or app instance above it.\n\n    #### Window\n\n    Windows are instantiated and attached to Host, where they are displayed within the Host's bounds. Windows may be movable, resizable, closable, maximizable, and minify-able.  Once a window is minimized, there's no built-in UI to restore it, but you can hook the Host's window list into a Menu fairly easily to provide access to raise and restore windows.\n  "]}]}," ",{t:7,e:"tab",m:[{n:"title",f:"Usage",t:13,g:1}],f:[{t:7,e:"marked",f:["    ### Plugin options\n\n    * `name: string = 'host'` - the name to use when registering the window host as a component\n\n    ### Host\n    \n    #### Attributes\n\n    * `placement: 'grid' | 'smart'` - the placement algorithm to use when placing a new unpositioned window. `grid` placement uses 3x3 grid that remembers where a window was last placed. `smart` placement computes the portion of the host where the window would overlap the least with the other windows.\n\n    #### Children\n\n    * `max-top` - content to display at the top of the host when windows are maximized. When a window is maximized, it has no titlebar or controls, so if you need to maintain those, you can do so with the `max-top` section.\n\n    #### API\n\n    * `current: Window` - get the top-level window\n    * `currentId: string` - get the id of the top-level window\n    * `windows: string[]` - get the list of all window ids\n    * `addWindow(window: Window, options)` - add the given window to the host.
